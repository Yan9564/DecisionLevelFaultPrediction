# DecisionLevelFaultPrediction
- This repository includes code and simulation dataset in paper xxx

## Simulated data
- __wheeli_simulated.xlsx__ are the simulated vibration signals of wheel $i$, where $i=1,2,3,4$
- Due to privivy issue, we do not provid the original data in real applications. 
- However, we provide the simulated data.
- The simulated data are generated by manipulating the original data in real applications.

## Codes
- proposed_simulation1_public.ipynb: proposed method in simulated case 1 
  - current state: first version upload, but need revision, to be continued 
- proposed_simulation2_public.ipynb: proposed method in simulated case 2
  - Current state: to be uploaded

current state: to be continued
