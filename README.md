# DecisionLevelFaultPrediction
- This repository includes code and simulation dataset in paper xxx

## Simulated data
- __wheeli_simulated.xlsx__ are the simulated vibration signals of wheel $i$, where $i=1,2,3,4$
  - Due to privivy issue, we do not provid the original data in real applications. 
  - However, we provide the simulated data.
  - The simulated data are generated by manipulating the original data in real applications.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7
- Numpy 1.16.2
- Pandas 0.24.2
- Pickle
- tqdm 4.31.1
- sklearn 0.21.3
- Scipy 1.2.1
- opencv-python 4.1.0.25
- PyWavelets 1.0.2

- torchvision >= 0.40


## Codes
- proposed_simulation1_public.ipynb: proposed method in simulated case 1 
  - current state: first version upload, but need revision, to be continued 
- proposed_simulation2_public.ipynb: proposed method in simulated case 2
  - Current state: to be uploaded
