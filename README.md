# DecisionLevelFaultPrediction
- This repository includes code and simulation dataset in paper xxx

## Data
- __wheeli_simulated.xlsx__ are the simulated vibration signals of wheel $i$, where $i=1,2,3,4$
  - Due to privacy issue, we do not provide the original data in real applications.
  - However, we provide the simulated data.
  - The simulated data are generated by manipulating the original data in real applications.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9.7
- Numpy 1.20.3
- Pandas 1.3.4
- scipy
- time
- tensorflow 2.7.0
- keras 2.7.0
- sklearn 0.24.2
- [NBEATS](https://pypi.org/project/NBEATS/)
- [nbeats_pytorch](https://pytorch-forecasting.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/ar.html)
- torch


## Codes
- proposed_simulation1_public.ipynb: proposed method in simulated case 1 
  - current state: first version upload, but need revision, to be continued 
- proposed_simulation2_public.ipynb: proposed method in simulated case 2
  - current state: to be uploaded
