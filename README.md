# DecisionLevelFaultPrediction
- This repository includes code and simulation dataset in paper:
_Xiaobing Ma, Bingxin Yan, Han Wang, and Haitao Liao. Decision-level machinery fault prognosis using N-BEATS-based degradation feature prediction and reconstruction. Accepted by Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing_

## Data
- __wheeli_simulated.xlsx__ are the simulated vibration signals of wheel $i$, where $i=1,2,3,4$
  - Due to privacy issues, we do not provide the original data in real applications. 
  - However, we provide the simulated data.
  - The simulated data are generated by manipulating the original data in real applications.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9.7
- Numpy 1.20.3
- Pandas 1.3.4
- scipy
- time
- tensorflow 2.7.0
- keras 2.7.0
- sklearn 0.24.2
- [NBEATS](https://pypi.org/project/NBEATS/)
- [nbeats_pytorch](https://pytorch-forecasting.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/ar.html)
- torch


## Codes
- proposed_simulation1_public.ipynb: proposed method in simulated case 1 
  - current state: first version upload.
